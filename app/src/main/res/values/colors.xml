    fit about other colors I tried and I'm running out of time here -->

     aesthetic sensibility (I think a lot of these look very ugly but the accessibility scanner
     thinks the contrast is better) -->

    <!-- I'm especially not a fan of being forced onto this fabColor by the accessibility scanner
    because the main point of the fab is to stand out against the background, which is white, but
    for some reason the scanner refuses to accept what I assume is the contrast between the black
    symbol and the fab color unless the fab color is almost completely white at which point it
    becomes difficult to make out the fab against the background to begin with, which defeats the
    purpose of a fab, I'm malding, losing hair by the second because I am so mad, etc etc etc. -->
    <!-- I assume the point is that the accessibility scanner gives suggestions that we can choose
    to follow or not, but I'm not 100% sure about how accessibility is graded here -->
